WARNING: The Antenna Switch Adapter may be powered by 12VDC or the 5VDC USB connector but
not by both.

1> Normal operation: Jumper JP1 is installed between pin 1 and 2 and then 12VDC is
applied at the coax board power connector CN2. The USB development connector cable is 
NOT connected.

2> Program Development: Jumper JP1 is removed. Then the development USB cable is 
connected. If the relays need to be actuated during development, 12 VDC may then be 
applied to the coax board power connector CN2.

NOTE: Jumper JP1 with jumper installed is intended to physically interfere with and 
prevent connecting the USB cable.
